0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stop overthinking & trust me on this one - does more than just the job at a budget price!,"Ordered during Great Indian Festival.
Effective price after SBI Discount was Rs. 2250/-

I ordered this product after thorough research.
And I am happy that for this price, it exceeds my expectations.

Design - Similar to Nord Buds the first. But, both the gray and white colors have some faint dotted design over the case and the stem of the buds. Faint flue dots over white. I was not prepared for that, at first glance, it looks a little dusty but can be overlooked.
Both the case and buds are very lightweight and easy to carry.
However, what I found to be a downside is that the buds dont have any magnetic attraction between them, so while they're easy to place in the case, outside the case they can't be clubbed together.

Fit - Fits perfectly. No pain/discomfort. When I move my head from side to side, they stay put. I ran on the treadmill for a few minutes at 12kmph. They didn’t even budge. It didn’t feel like they would slip out. Which is great.

Call Quality - The thing I was most worried about. And it passes the test. I live on a quiet street though - The other person is able to hear me loud and clear, and sometimes, ambient sound is also audible to them but the volume of that sound is much lower than my voice so it is not bothersome. Even in busier surroundings, no one has complained about my call quality yet!

Audio Quality - I'm quite fond of listening to loud music. This does more than just justice to the loudness. I am more than happy listening at 50% volume. It’s definitely bass heavy. The quality of the sound is clear and crisp. I am very happy.

ANC - It was not a priority for me, however, I did try it. Noise cancellation is definitely very effective. It does as much as promised, not more. However, there is a faint hissing sound. But it doesn’t bother me when playing some music or audio.

Hey Melody - Its NOT detecting my earbuds yet lol. I'm an apple user. Let's see I'll try pairing it properly.

Switching between devices - Unpair with one to pair with another. Not much of a hassle though, its fairly quick. And it automatically pairs with my phone as soon as I take it out of the case.

Battery Life - Yet to be explored! I’m someone who carries all my chargers on the go and tend to keep all my devices well charged, so I don’t think I’ll be able to face much issue.

My Personal Reasons why I didn't go for Buds Z2 even though my budget was flexible -

1. In Ear Detection - if it goes haywire, I don't think there's an option to turn it off.
2. Glossy finish - I was afraid it would slip out.
3. It was released in 2021. About time we got a Z3, no?

Reasons why I wanted Z2 -

1. 3 mics
2. Google pairing - easy switch between devices
3. More premium product

Am I happy I went with this and not with Z2 - MOST DEFINITELY YES!!!",Reviewed in India on 10 October 2023,Verified Purchase,Colour: Lightning WhiteSize: Extra LargeStyle Name: Nord Buds 2
1,4.0 out of 5 stars,Surprised me in the price range,"After 3 years of extremely rough use knockoff Chinese wireless Bluetooth earbud kicked the bucket. Earbud, because one of them still work(and people say Chinese tech is poorly made). At the time of buying those knockoff earbuds it was around the same price as these One Plus Nord Buds 2 price range, actually I believe it was slightly cheaper(I cannot for the life of me remember). I am not a heavy earbuds user, I mostly use it to listen to podcasts in the morning and pair it with my laptop to listen to music while I work at night. The buds seldom leave the vicinity of my work desk at home, no exposure to the elements of nature and no exposure to sweat. I clean my earbuds regularly. That being said I do listen to a wide range of music, I'm no audiophile, but can identify change in quality in the listening device.

With that in mind, these earbuds offer an okay sound quality, hence why I gave it 4 stars, the sound quality is clear and don't have much noise, the trebles are well balanced so as to not rupture your eardrums, but the bass is overblown which is why I gave it 3 stars. The bass drowns out the other sounds, and overwhelms your ear. Especially if you are listening to an orchestral piece, you'll struggle appreciate the individual artists. This can be solved with software to a certain extent. By using the ""HeyMelody"" app you can configure your OnePlus Nord Buds 2. You can use pre configured sound profiles like Balanced, Bold, Serenade, or Bass. There is also the BassWave option which allows you to adjust the clarity and fidelity of the bass via software. If you are still unsatisfied you can configure your own custom profile by adding an equalizer and creating the ideal audio setup.

Now one of the more attractive feature of these buds I have seen from other buyers is the ANC at this price point. Honestly I don't really use the feature that much, mostly because I like to be aware of my surroundings and not get completely immersed in whatever I'm doing on the computer/phone. But the ANC works kinda well? I mean it's not the same as Apple's ANC, but for 3k you should temper your expectations. By holding down on the touch gesture surface on the ear buds or by going into the app on your phone you can enable ANC. It was able to completely tune out the ambient buzzing sound of my Air Conditioning, which is old and loud, so I think the ANC is very good. The only thing is when there is no audio playing you'll hear a hissing or buzzing sound if you have ANC enabled. It's not super annoying, but that is just my personal opinion.

As for battery backup, I have managed to go 2 days without charging the buds, but this is with light usage. It still has 90% left even after I have used it for 2 days so I think the battery backup is good. The case is sturdy and the buds fall into place within the case magnetically. Bluetooth connectivity is seamless and that's all I have to say about the buds.

I have however talked to people that bought these buds as a part of expanding their OnePlus ecosystem, and they claim that these buds are amazing when paired with their OnePlus phone or OnePlus tablet. I wouldn't know, I don't believe in ecosystems.

But people, for 3k this is totally worth the price. Haven't met with any issues till now, if I do I'll make sure to update this review. Cheers",Reviewed in India on 2 July 2023,Verified Purchase,Colour: Thunder GreySize: Extra LargeStyle Name: Nord Buds 2

5,4.0 out of 5 stars,Go for it without any second thought if you are looking for a budget friendly buds,"I purchased these earbuds last year and undoubtedly after one year of use I would say I am happy about these earbuds. I was looking for a budget friendly earbuds with ANC along with good music quality as I am a frequent music listner. The first thing I want to mention about ANC that is excellent for this price range you can't ask more with such affordable price, second is the sound quality again as per this price range it is phenomenal with great balance bass and punchy beats and if you turn ON ANC and listen music then it's gives one of the best sound quality.Third is battery life ,when I bought these buds it was giving 4 5 hours average backup as generally no body continuously use for 4 5 hours unless you are not traveling. But after 6 7 months battery backup started falling slightly that is quite understanding and ok cause there was no drastic fall in the backup. You can again recharge as the case charging itself last for 10 hours so overall you can expect 7 8 hours backup with the case. Fourth is the call quality I will not say that call quality is excellent because as a regular user what I realised you can't expect any wireless earbuds to be excellent in the call quality like we listen over regular phone mic. But I will say the call quality is up to the mark it is not complete worse and if you want everything at best level obviously you have to pay more price. There is one more feature I found it useful lost bud sound that is quite loud if you lost your earbuds but the problem is the buds should be connected with the phone.
Last but not the least unfortunate I lost these earbuds 1 week ago so I thought why shouldn't I give me honest review whoever want to purchase a best buy within affordable price range.
Final review is go for it if you want to have an Excellent earbuds within pocket friendly range everything do justice with the prices it comes with. If you want to still do the complaints then spend some amount.",Reviewed in India on 30 October 2024,Verified Purchase,Colour: Thunder GreySize: Extra LargeStyle Name: Nord Buds 2

7,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the price,"I bought this product recently. Used it full-fledged for about 10 days. I am using this product with realme gt2 pro.

Lets talk about cons first

1. Ear comfort of this product is ok but not
great. Using more than 1 hr ear
starts to hurt and painful. You need to
remove buds from ear and then keep
again to tackle the pain. I tried other ear
tips which comes in the box. tried small
ear tips which made comfort even worse
and painful.

2 when audio is paused you will hear some
kind of gizzz sound which is very
annoying may be it is to handle outside
sound it seems. In transparency mode
gizz sound is less as you will hear outside
noise. When your not playing anything
keep buds aside or in the box donot
keep in ears. Trust me you will definitely
feel discomfort.

3 ANC - Active Noise Cancellation is
working good but not great. You can still
hear outside noises. But it does have
difference. 50 percent of noises will be
reduced but not complete isolation.

4 Hey Melody App. when phone bluetooth
is on buds will automatically pairs which
is great but when you go into app it still
shows select device to connect. But from
bluetooth settings i am able to select
and configure the product. I feel if device
is connected app should atleast show it
is connected.

Pros
1. Sound Quality is great.

2. Bass is great.

3. Switching with between multiple device
is great as it wont automatically shift to
other device and you have to touch and
hold long to shift and continue using. It
can be configure from app.

4. Battery backup is good.

5. Having ANC in this price is great.

6. Ear fitting is great. It wont fall from the
ear.

The fit is comfortable, and the battery life is impressive for daily use.

13,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best buds for your ear with standard quality,"I’m a big fan of headphones—some might even call it an obsession. Since this is one of my favorite areas in electronics, expect a detailed review.

Before diving in, I believe in establishing benchmarks, as comparing products helps assess their performance effectively.

I own at least one headphone from every category—not meant as a brag, but to highlight my passion for varied content consumption.

So, why did I choose these?

It was a tough choice between the Oppo Enco Buds 2 and these, with the main differences being price and some features. Ultimately, I opted for these because for just a little more, I get IP55 rating and a larger driver.

That said, a larger driver doesn’t necessarily mean better sound.

Previously, I was using Skullcandy Spoke, which many enthusiasts might recognize as quite muted. You have to crank the volume above 70% to catch all the details, and they’re nearly inaudible outdoors. So even if the OnePlus turns out to be a poor choice, at least I won't be stuck with earbuds that lack volume.

Likes:

Excellent design—sturdy and not flimsy.
Good sound quality for the price.
Long battery life, though not the best in class.
Stem design looks nice and fits snugly.
Quick switch feature is a plus.

Dislikes:

Missing features like a functional game mode and volume controls on the earbuds.
Accidental touches when putting them on or taking them off—not a deal-breaker, but common in the industry.
Concern about losing the buds during physical activities.
More customization options in the app would be appreciated.
Strangely, the large ear tips fit worse than the medium ones, even though I used the larger tips with my OnePlus neckband.",Reviewed in India on 24 October 2024,Verified Purchase,Colour: Deep GreySize: Extra LargeStyle Name: Nord Buds 2r

42,5.0 out of 5 stars,**Review Title:** Outstanding Sound Quality with Impressive Battery Life,"**Review:**
I recently purchased the OnePlus Buds 2R, and after using them extensively for a month, I feel confident in sharing my detailed review. These earbuds are an excellent addition to OnePlus’s audio lineup, offering a mix of stellar sound quality, impressive battery life, and a comfortable fit. Below, I will discuss various aspects including design, comfort, sound quality, battery life, connectivity, and overall value.

**Design and Comfort:**
The OnePlus Buds 2R boast a minimalist and sleek design. They come in a compact, oval-shaped charging case that easily fits in pockets and bags. The earbuds themselves have a matte finish which adds a premium touch and makes them less prone to fingerprints.

In terms of comfort, the OnePlus Buds 2R are exceptionally light and fit snugly in the ear. They come with multiple sizes of silicone ear tips, ensuring a secure and comfortable fit for different ear shapes. I’ve worn them for extended periods without experiencing any discomfort, making them ideal for long listening sessions or workouts.

**Sound Quality:**
The sound quality of the OnePlus Buds 2R is where these earbuds truly shine. They are equipped with 10mm dynamic drivers that deliver a rich and balanced sound profile. The bass is punchy without being overwhelming, the mids are clear and well-defined, and the highs are crisp and detailed. Whether I was listening to music, podcasts, or watching movies, the audio performance was consistently excellent.

Additionally, the OnePlus Buds 2R support Dolby Atmos, which significantly enhances the spatial audio experience, providing a more immersive sound. The passive noise isolation, while not as effective as active noise cancellation, does a decent job of blocking out ambient noise, making them suitable for use in various environments.

**Battery Life:**
Battery life is another strong point for the OnePlus Buds 2R. On a full charge, the earbuds provide up to 7 hours of continuous playback, and the charging case offers an additional 30 hours of battery life. The case supports fast charging, and just 10 minutes of charging provides up to 10 hours of playback time, which is incredibly convenient for those on the go.

**Connectivity:**
The OnePlus Buds 2R feature Bluetooth 5.2, ensuring a stable and reliable connection. Pairing the earbuds with my devices was seamless, and I didn’t experience any dropouts or connectivity issues during use. They also support Fast Pair, making it quick and easy to connect to OnePlus smartphones and other compatible devices. The touch controls are responsive and intuitive, allowing me to manage playback, adjust volume, and access voice assistants with ease.

**Additional Features:**
The OnePlus Buds 2R come with a few noteworthy features that enhance the overall user experience. They are IP55 rated, meaning they are resistant to dust and water splashes, making them suitable for workouts and outdoor activities. Additionally, the earbuds have a low latency mode, which is particularly beneficial for gaming and watching videos, ensuring audio and video sync perfectly.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the OnePlus Buds 2R offer exceptional value for their price. They combine high-quality sound, impressive battery life, and a comfortable fit, making them a great choice for both casual listeners and audiophiles. While they lack active noise cancellation, the passive noise isolation is adequate for most environments. If you’re looking for reliable and high-performing earbuds without breaking the bank, the OnePlus Buds 2R are definitely worth considering.

**Pros:**
- Excellent sound quality with balanced audio profile
- Impressive battery life with fast charging
- Comfortable and secure fit
- Reliable connectivity with Bluetooth 5.2
- IP55 rating for dust and water resistance
- Low latency mode for gaming and videos

**Cons:**
- No active noise cancellation
- Limited color options

I highly recommend the OnePlus Buds 2R for anyone in search of high-quality, affordable wireless earbuds.

43,4.0 out of 5 stars,Second times the charm,"I brought this OnePlus Nord 2 on Great Indian Festival sale and the horror when I got a used defective product! What followed were two days of restlessness as the associates tried their best to register a replacement. And finally I got a new one!

Pris: Coming to the actual product: Sleek design, comfortable on ears for longer periods (m talking 12-13 hrs), bass is more than decent. Has two modes and ANC is to kill for! I think that's the only reason I went back to my this the second time. Battery life is decent. Can give a run for money to any high end earphones in 5k-10k range.

Cons: Nice earbuds but NOT comfortable at all or as described. My ear hurts in under 2 to 2 and half hours of use then I has to switch these earbuds to right bud in my left ear and left one in right ear it's too frustrating and while doing this you loose all the sound quality.

68,4.0 out of 5 stars,From An iPhone User’s Perspective.,"Quick Verdict:
1. Sound Good .
2. Good battery life and Well built.
3. Clear mics.
4. Can’t access basic features on iOS .
5. Not recommended as a primary set of earbuds for iOS devices.
6. One Plus has not added support for these buds in their HeyMelody app on iOS, they have added support for others.

Background

• Purchased as a spare for 2nd Gen AirPods Pro.
• Primary devices are iPhone and iPad; also own an older Android (Poco F1).

Sound Quality (7/10): Warm and Vibrant

• Impressively balanced with a V-shaped sound signature.
• Sound stage is average, decent stereo separation.
• Bass: Clean , booming, but lacks definition.
• Mids: Enhanced by a less aggressive sound signature, decent for vocals and string instruments.
• Highs: Detailed but can be harsh or sibilant at times.
• AirPods Pro: Tighter bass, vibrant mids, detailed highs, and superior sound stage. I know it’s an unfair comparison.

Features

1. ANC (5/10)
• Ineffective except against low-frequency noises like an AC.
• Slight hiss when ANC is active.
2. Transparency (6/10)
• Mediocre compared to AirPods’ transparency mode.
3. Touch/Tap Controls (6.5/10)
• Customizable via Android only.
• No volume adjustment.
• Not very responsive; prone to accidental taps.
4. Ear Detection
• Does not function on iOS.
5. Microphones
• Do their job. No problems.

Battery & Charging

• Lasts approximately 6-6.5 hours with 50% volume and ANC on.
• Charges quickly: 0 to 30-40% rapidly.
• USB-C case provides three additional full charges.

iOS Limitations

• No customization of sound profiles, dynamic bass, or firmware updates.
• Lacks Dolby Atmos and Dirac support.
• Does not support seamless device switching.

Workaround

• Pair and customize on an Android device; settings save to buds.
• Settings carry over when reconnected to iOS but require re-customization for changes.
• Similar restrictions apply to Apple’s AirPods.",Reviewed in India on 24 April 2024,Verified Purchase,Colour: Lightning WhiteSize: Extra LargeStyle Name: Nord Buds 2

I am writing it after 8~9 months of usage. I purchased it for listening online classes. It worked fine.
I would recommend to have ear lock otherwise it may frequently drop.
One of the ear phone was not working,May be I had dropped it multiple times. But the product is good.
I am giving 4 star as ear lock is must.
Now I checked, there was a plastic in between in the ear phone case that was avoiding recharging. After removing that plastic , now it's getting recharge.
