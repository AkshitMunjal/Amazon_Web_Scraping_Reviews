0,5.0 out of 5 stars,V good functional airpods,I've used it for a month now. Battery life is decent. If you take out of the charging box the airpods will work for good 2.5 hrs. Once charged the case will charge the airpods for 2 days easily. Sound quality is clear and crisp. It doesn't weigh much so you won't feel it hanging like a rock. I have dropped the case sone times as well but they work just fine and there is no crack either. It's just that the orientation of the pods in the case is a bit awkward so you may drop it if you try to put it back in the dark. But that's not a problem. Overall it's a good product value for money,Reviewed in India on 17 December 2024,Verified Purchase,Colour: Thunder Blue
1,4.0 out of 5 stars,great product under low price range,"Pros:
1. The level of volume it gets to, is just awesome, it can get incredibly loud so if you're at the gym, these are perfect.
2. Awesome Bass!
3. Noise cancellation is just great, if you simply put them on without even any music playing, u won't be able to hear things around u very well, it's great for places like Gym.
4. Lovely battery life, I've had them a week and only had to charge the case once, that too for just a few minutes. And the earbuds themselves, leave them in case for just five min and you'll be getting battery for a long long while.
5. They are very comfortable, can be used for long periods of time.
6. Affordable!
7. The touch controls are very responsive, tap to pause, double tap right one for next song, double tap left one for either rewind or previous song. Can also pick up calls just by tapping.
8. Multiple ear coverings are provided with it.
9. Type C port

Cons:
1. The sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc. The bass is the highlight so it's great for music, but for movies or gaming, you won't get the most crisp audio.
2. Some connectivity issues, sometimes i have to turn my Bluetooth on and off many times for it to work (this is occasional, not a daily or frequent occurrence) [Edit after 1 month use: it's now a very frequent issue]
3. The mic quality is good if you are using your phone, but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on PC
4. Sometimes on WhatsApp, the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds, so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes. (Not an issue if you are the one dialing) i hope it's just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issue.

Overall, I needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there (lol) so I'm very very happy with them
Highly recommended for music and/or as a more affordable option as compared to JBL etc.",Reviewed in India on 2 January 2023,Verified Purchase,Colour: Bold Black
2,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best airpods,"The gaming ability was super and functionality was not up to the mark, sound quality while listening it's super but while talking it's just good, and also it's value for money, the Design is so simple and also it was comfort to use.",Reviewed in India on 21 November 2024,Verified Purchase,Colour: Bold Black
3,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, but connectivity issues and sometimes left bud stops working.","It is an okay product, if you can then you should avoid buying it, especially if you are going to use it for multiple devices. If your intended use is going to be a single device, then buying this is not a problem. Apart from the connectivity issues, sometimes the left earbud will stop working altogether. Sometimes the battery dies down a lot quicker than you anticipate.",Reviewed in India on 18 November 2024,Verified Purchase,Colour: Olive Green
4,4.0 out of 5 stars,True review after a week long use .....,"I am writing a true review after around a week long use of these boat airdopes 141 ....
CONS
1. the mic is average and the voice feels a little modulated on the mic provided .
2. the case is little bulky due to longer battery life but you will get used to it in about 2 to 3 days. The case quality is decent but the case lid feels like its built out of crappy plastic and doesnt feel robust or stable in hand.
3. these airdopes are based on bluetooth v 5.0 and later and they will work great with all the devices having the same bluetooth version i.e v5.0 or newer however in case of older versions there is a lot of latency lag. I personally use these with my laptop that has v5.0 and they work great however when i connect them with my android phone which has bluetooth v 4.10 , the experience is horrendous ... there are many problems like latency lag, voice breaks etc even when the bt v.50 is backwards compatible .... i experience this latency lag and voice break during calling , whatsapp calling and playing simple mobile games. Despite all this there is no problem while streaming songs on these airdopes.
4. there is a lot of voice leakage if you use them on 100 percent volume both on laptop and mobile phones you will have to tweak them ... the voice is also kind of high so you will not be able to listen to anything on 100 percent anyhow .... 50 to 60 is an ideal level for all the movies and games as well as music.
5. Your ears will hurt after prolonged usage of these if you dont select the right size of air caps ... 3 sizes are already provided inside the box.
6. The biggest con while using these airdopes on windows is that you cannot use the airdopes and the inbuilt mic together .... windows doesnt allow it even if you try very hard to use both the mic and airdopes output speaker together Its a windows issue but is manageable .
7.Another big problem is that the voice control option is absent on the airdopes and the volume cant be controlled from the airdopes ... you will have to control it from the device which is also a big problem .

PROS-
1. the sound quality and the bass are great .
2. the battery life is great you can easily use them for 7 to 8 hours on continuous usage.
3. They charge very quickly, in a jiffy.
4. They feel even greater if you enable surround sound while using them on windows platform.
5. the connectivity is great too ;as soon as you open the case they will automatically detect and connect to the available devices that you paired them with earlier within seconds.
6. There is literally zero latency and zero lag on these while connected on the same bluetooth version .... i used these on my laptop and played all the games like cs go, valorant, gta 5, and other games but there is no issue while gaming or music.
7.There is a support for mono audio and you can use one airdope at a time instead of using both.
8.Boat has provided a year's warranty on these so they can be easily replaced in case of a damage if the damage occurs within the given time frame .

Overall the product can be optimized a bit more but is still good to use now and is a decent purchase on this price point ; however better options are available if you intend to use it just for calling purpose , better go with something wired or something that comes with older bt versions if you intend to use them with devices with older bluetooth versions .",Reviewed in India on 3 September 2021,Verified Purchase,NA
5,3.0 out of 5 stars,:),"""I'm satisfied with my Airdopes purchase, but they have their strengths and weaknesses. On the positive side, the sound quality is good, making them suitable for music and lectures, which was my primary reason for buying them. The design is also comfortable and lightweight, making them easy to wear for extended periods without feeling painful in the ears.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The voice clarity is just okay, and not exceptional. Additionally, the call quality is not the best, but that wasn't a key factor for me.

Overall, I'd say the Airdopes are a satisfactory choice for anyone looking for a budget-friendly option for listening to music and lectures. Just be aware of the potential drawbacks, and you'll be fine!""",Reviewed in India on 10 November 2024,Verified Purchase,Colour: Bold Black

31,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bad product overall. Too much cons,"Pros>
Only sound quality is good.
Durable. They're surving after more than a year when they fall atleast once a week from me.

Cons>>>>
Charging speed is slower after 1 year.
Playback time is way less. Earbuds dircharge and starts beeping after 1.5-2 hours of continuous use. Not for binge watching. Their 6 hours claim is false.
Deserves negative rating for microphone quality and Enx noice cancellation... So bad for taking calls as it hears every outside noise and everything but not my voice when I put them on. Had to switch to microphone for a call. You're not heard using these even at your home with a bit of ceiling fan voice... Forget about outdoors lol. Maybe this functions on reverse noice cancellation.
Big and uncomfortable to carry in a pocket but manageable.
Wireless range is poor. Their 10m range claim is false. It doesn't catches signal sometimes from my pocket too.
Not enough features, only single device connectivity at a time.
